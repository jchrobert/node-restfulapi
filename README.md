You have to start a local MongoDB instance to make the project work.

* MongoDB configuration:
config/db.js
* User configuration: config/admin.js
* JWT secret key: security/config.js

This config informations are 'hardcoded' because it is a sample project.
It should be define as properties in environment files.
